    SKIP_ACCOUNTS:           # Set to a space separated list to exclude a subset of accounts.  Default: include all accounts
    EXPIRATION_DAYS:         # Set to treat RIs that expire with the specified number of days as already expired

    FILTER_THRESHOLD: 3      # Threshold for reducing noise on instances slope fit (THRESHOLD below)
    RI_TERM: 36              # Term for RIs to be purchased.  12 or 36.  Default: 36
    RI_OPTION: No Upfront    # Purchasing Option.  If selected option is not available, all options will be attempted

                             #     if no sizes smaller than this are available.  Additional values: smallest, largest

    # THRESHOLD: Thresholds are against the slope of running instances, specifically units per day.  For example,
    #            a threshold of 1000 means an average daily increase of 125xlarge instances of the type being evaluated.
    #            AGGRESSIVE_THRESHOLD is >= this value, CONSERVATIVE_THRESHOLD is <= the value.
    #            An empty threshold will not be evaluated.
    # STANDARD / CONVERTIBLE: STANDARD purchases will be evaluated first, CONVERTIBLE purchases will assume standard
    #                         purchases are being purchased too.
    # UTIL_TARGET: The RI Utilization amount to target when the specified threshold has been met.  Some examples
    #              100: Require the RI would be fully utilized 100% of the time based on historical data.
    #              80: Require the RI would be fully utilized at least 80% of the time based on historical data.
    #              BREAK_EVEN: Require the RI would be utilized at least the break-even precentage based on the
    #                          savings expected between on-demand and RI Cost
    #              NONE: Do not recommend RIs

    # SLUSH_ACCOUNT: The slush account has 2 main influences on RI Evaluations.
    #             1) Existing RIs in the slush account are not counted toward float from the per-account evaluation,
    #                so that the accounts with persistent demand are expected to purchase their share.
    #                * NOT YET IMPLEMENTED # FIXME
    #             2) Addtional RIs are recommended for the slush account based on the total RI demand in excess of the
    #                sum of the per-account demand.  Since this utilization target may be set higher for the slush
    #                account, this is to be expected, however even when the slush target equals the per-account target,
    #                slush RIs will be purchased when total_demand > sum(account_demand)
    #          NOTE: Due to the nature of the slush account, only convertible RIs should be configured.
